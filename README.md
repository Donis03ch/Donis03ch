# Introduction

**Who is donis03ch ?**

I'm a motivated upcoming software developer, studying in Switzerland.

**Why am I here ?**

- I'm here for the obvious reason of giving people the chance to see my process of building apps. 
- Connecting with people and sharing knowledge with each other are other aspects, which I also very much favor.
